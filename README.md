# AN-INTEGRATED-APPROACH-FOR-THE-DETECTION-OF-RETINAL-DISEASES-USING-CNN
## INTRODUCTION
Glaucoma is caused by high intraocular pressure, it is more likely to develop in persons who have a family history of the disease and people who have specific eye disorders such as diabetes or shortsightedness, are more prone to develop the disease. The most important effect of this disease is the loss of vision and sometimes this effect might become permanent. Glaucoma is generally found in people over age above 60. There are several causes due to which glaucoma is found, they can be poor or reduced blood flow to the optic nerve of the eye and sometimes due to the blocked or restricted drainage in the eye. Sometimes people who commonly use eye drops or medications, such as corticosteroids have more chances to get affected by this disease. The below classification of glaucoma is based on the crucial interior of eye physique factors which are generally used to classify various types of glaucoma. 
### Open-Angle Glaucoma / Chronic Glaucoma: Open-angle or chronic glaucoma can cause vision loss by slowing down the vision. This type's indications and symptoms aren't detected until later on. It might cause permanent visual loss if not recognised and treated early. 

### Angle-Closure Glaucoma / Acute Glaucoma: For the most part, this is an emergency situation. High pressure in the eyes is caused by a sudden obstruction in the aqueous humor fluid. Nausea, extreme discomfort, and blurred vision are all symptoms. Congenital Glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma is caused by a defect in the eye's angular location. This can be detected through family members or from parents to children. It inhibits the drainage mechanisms that produce excessive weeping, light sensitivity, and impaired vision.  Secondary Glaucoma: Eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma. It can also be caused by eye diseases like cataracts or tumors. Itchy eyes and iris pain are common in this case.

Normal Tension Glaucoma: Damage of the optic nerve in the eye causes normal tension glaucoma to develop. The main cause of this type of glaucoma is a lack of blood flow to the optic nerve and increase of pressure on the fundus. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
An early detection of glaucoma is particularly significant since it allows timely treatment to prevent major visual field loss and prolongs the effective years of usable vision. The diagnosis of glaucoma can be done through measurement of **CDR (cup- to-disc ratio)** and OCT images.

## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of our project is to create a machine learning model to detect glaucoma in early
stages. 1. To detect glaucoma through the analysis of complete eye fundus image by developing a CNN. 2. To combine the results with previously computed cup to disc ratio

# AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to calculate cup to disc ratio and apply further deep learning techniques to a pre-trained CNN to detect glaucoma.
